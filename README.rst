    Homepage:    http://riggingtd.com
    Version:     3.0.0
    Requires:    Maya 2011 x64 or above
    Platform:    Windows 64bit, Mac OS X, Linux 64bit
    License:     BSD license


Description:
----------------------------------------------
    Soft Cluster EX is a python and c++ based tool for converting soft selection to
    cluster or joint, supports common types of deformable geometry(e.g. polygon,nurbs
	,subdiv and lattice) with a lot of advance features.


Install:
----------------------------------------------
    1. Place SoftClusterEX folder into your maya script path.
       e.g., C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/maya/scripts/
       
       * NOTE 1: Please remove softClusterEX.py and softClusterEX.pyc first if you ever 
	             installed the 1.x version before.
	   * NOTE 2: Please remove the softSelectionQuery plugins from your plugin path 
	             (e.g., C:/Program Files/Autodesk/Maya<Version>/bin/plug-ins/) if you 
				 ever installed 2.6.0 version or older.
			   
    2. Drag "install.mel" into maya scene, a new button will appear in your current shelf, 
       click it to launch. (Recommend!)


Usage:
----------------------------------------------
If you don't like to use "install.mel" to help you install, run the following code in maya's
python tab is also okay. 

    import SoftClusterEX
    SoftClusterEX.launch()


Features:
----------------------------------------------
#### General functionality:

  - supports create cluster or joint from polygon, nurbsSurface, nurbsCurve, subdiv and lattice
  - all types can be toggled on/off from UI
  - supports create cluster or joint from multi objects of different type
  - change falloff mode
  - supports exclude influenced objects and groups while working on Global falloff mode
  - supports objects with duplicate name
  - ultra high performance, even working on massive density geometry
  - mirror cluster or joint in local or world space, also support working on
    multiple types of deformable geometry
  - redefine weight with soft selection
  - supports export and import weight

#### Command line:

  - The core function of this tool comes from the custom command "softSelectionQuery",
    you can use it to implement your own tools.

  - Synopsis: softSelectionQuery [flags] [String...]
      - sl -selection                            return a list contains transforms and vertices
      - tr -transforms                           return transform names of influenced objects
      - s -shapeNames:                           return shape names of influenced objects 
      - vtx -vertices:                           return vertices of influenced objects  
      - ap -allPaths:                            return partial paths to objects in DAG
      - l -long:                                 return full path names for Dag objects.
      - c -count:                                return count of influenced objects          
      - nt -nodeTypes:                           return type names of influenced objects
      - ant -apiNodeTypes:                       return api type name of influenced objects  
      - exo -excludeObjects  String (multi-use): set exclude objects	  
      - t -types           String (multi-use):   set support types
      - w -weights:                              return weights of influenced components


Todo:
----------------------------------------------
  - None

  
Limitation
----------------------------------------------
  - Joint function can't work with subdiv since MFnSkinCluster incompatible with this type of geometry
